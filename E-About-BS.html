  <p> Everything you need to know about Brandon "Eternal" Vigil in 2 simple paragraphs.  Starting off, he was getting in trouble in elementary school for speeding through his class work and homework assignments so he could get back to reading sci-fi novels (mostly Star Wars).  His father had always raised him on a steady diet of Douglas Adams, Monty Python and Star Trek: The Next Generation and his work at Disney Studios made him an avid watcher of movies.  Going into his high school years, his love for sci-fi continued but his friends introduced him to anime like Trigun, Dragon Ball Z and Cowboy Bebop.  This brought a brand new world of fiction into focus and series like Ghost in the Shell and Tank Police quickly become favorites of his.  This love of sci-fi exposed him to the vast potential of technology, specifically coding, where the tools and software you can create is only limited by your skills and imagination.</p>
  <p> Post high school / college years, Brandon threw himself into the field of computer science and software engineering in the hopes of finding logical challenges to solve as well as finding a career that would allow him to help provide for his family.  Unfortunately, life circumstances can change in an instant and his plans were disrupted, not allowing him to finish the last year of his 4 year program.  However, he found a well paying job, provided he learn HTML and CSS in less than 3 months.  Trial after trial conquered, he quickly discovered that he needed to expand his knowledge to include more than just front-end languages.  That's how he stumbled onto the UCLA Coding Bootcamp course and now into the second week, he has already been exposed to new tools that he can add to his repertoire. </p>
